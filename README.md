Current aquarium under construction

## Update
I have run into a bit of a paradox. It has to do with discrete dimensional space, and conservation of quanta. Not sure how I wish to solve this problem, since there is a non trivial chance that this problem is in reality a necessary emergent behavior of what I was trying to model. Due to the peculiarities of this problem I have decided to focus my efforts on other aspects of this project.

In addition I must also decide about the granularity of this observable set. If pockets of computational reducibility exist with a strong fuzzy bijection, then I may be able to skip some of the work that would have been put in making the HADEAN EPOCH aquarium. This would reduce the compute that each step takes. In order to explore this facet I will work on [FLOW](https://github.com/aquaviverium/flow) and set up a proto denotype clade.
